# Retro: #902 — Improvement roadmap: standardize the dependency diagram's dashed-edge vocabulary

## Stage: Planning (2026-09-27T00:44:21Z)

### Session summary

Planned an eight-step change: two Tidy-First refactors (a field-driven ordinal remap in `parseSteps`, a relation-parameterized `checkDependencyClaim`), then parser, validator, live-document, and skill/prompt steps.
The operator settled the vocabulary as two kinds (`-->` hard, `-.soft.->` soft), a both-directions soft check at warning severity, and soft bullets on Phase 15's five open steps only.

### Observations

- The issue's "two live roadmaps" premise had moved: pi-subagents Phase 22 is archived, so pi-permission-system Phase 15 (13 steps, 11 bare `-.->` edges, one `**Soft dependency:**` bullet) is the only live input.
- The corpus had a fourth spelling the issue did not list: archived pi-permission-system Phase 10 uses a pipe-labelled `-.->|"soft ordering — …"|`, which the current `EDGE` regex silently drops.
  The candidate regex was run over every roadmap diagram in the repo and caught it (old 1, new 2) without adding anything else.
- The landed-step rule (`improvement-discovery`: a landed step's field block stays as written) is why five soft warnings will stand on Phase 15's `✅` steps until it archives; this was put to the operator as a priced option rather than resolved silently.
- Each draft soft bullet's reason is taken from the roadmap's own prose or sweep dispositions, and every draft was run through `parseStepReferenceRun`. `#978`'s edge from `#979` carries only an operator placement decision, so its bullet says exactly that.
- Phase 15 already has 3 errors and 1 warning unrelated to this issue; the plan's per-step predicted-output table counts around them rather than fixing them.
- The `tidy-first-assessor` recommended the two refactors adopted as steps 1 and 2; `classifyLink` stays inside step 4 as new logic.

#### Deferred tidyings

- `scripts/roadmap/parse-roadmap.mjs`: `EDGE` does not read chained links (`A --> B --> C`) or `&` fan-out; no roadmap uses either today.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-09-27T01:00:16Z)

### Session summary

All eight planned steps landed as separate commits: two Tidy-First refactors, the soft-bullet parse, edge classification, the soft-claim warning, the unrecognized-edge error, the Phase 15 respell with five soft bullets, and the skill/prompt vocabulary.
Root tests went from 221 to 247; `check`, `lint`, and `fallow dead-code` are clean.

### Observations

- Every live-check prediction in the plan's table held exactly: 3 errors and 2 warnings after the soft check, 14 errors and 2 warnings after the spelling check, and 3 errors and 6 warnings after the Phase 15 respell.
- Deviation: `EDGE` also matches Mermaid's text-on-arrow forms (`-- x -->`, `== x ==>`), so they surface as unrecognized instead of being dropped; two extra table rows and a mutation pin it.
  The corpus re-run still shows only the Phase 10 pipe edge as a difference from the old pattern.
- Deviation: the acyclicity test `ignores soft edges` drew a soft back-edge with no bullet, which the new soft check warned on; its fixture gained the explaining `softDependency`, noted in the `feat:` commit body.
- The step 1 and step 3 killing mutations each reddened one more test than predicted (the bracketed-claim tests also depend on the remap converting reference objects to numbers); step 2's reddened all four hard-message tests, not three.
  All extra reds are discriminating, not noise.
- The step 4 commit used a heredoc `git commit -F -`, which `AGENTS.md` names as a deny-rule tripwire; the gate did not fire, and later commits used repeated `-m`.
- Pre-completion reviewer: WARN.
  Its two decision-surface findings ask whether `roadmap-check.mjs`, the only outside importer of `parseRoadmap`/`validateRoadmap`, still gets what it expects; it reads only finding fields, its unmodified test passes, and the reviewer's own live run matched the prediction.
  It independently confirmed byte-identical hard messages, a strict-superset edge capture over the whole corpus, and no edit to a landed Phase 15 step block.

## Stage: Sync (worktree) (2026-09-27T01:16:42Z)

### Session summary

Pre-push checks are clean (`pnpm run lint`, `pnpm fallow dead-code`).
The plan's `**Release:**` marker is `ship independently`, but nothing under `packages/` is release-scoped here (only `pi-permission-system`'s `docs/architecture/architecture.md`, which release tooling excludes), so this land triggers no package release.

**Peer session transcript:** `/Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-development-pi-pi-packages-worktrees-issue-902--/2026-09-27T00-32-07-011Z_01a0e046-bb62-75a5-9cfc-949dd349d490.jsonl` — read with `read_session_file({ path: "..." })` for message-level verification at land/retro time.

### Observations

No deferred work beyond what the TDD stage note already lists (chained-link/`&` fan-out parsing, out of scope by design).
Five warnings on Phase 15's landed steps are expected to persist until that phase archives.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-09-27T16:31:08Z)

### Session summary

The peer session planned and implemented the two-kind edge vocabulary (`-->` hard, `-.soft.->` soft) across `scripts/roadmap/`, the Phase 15 diagram, and the `improvement-discovery` skill in eight commits; the root session fast-forward-merged, passed CI, closed the issue, and tore down the worktree.
Nothing released: the only `packages/` file in range is an architecture doc outside release scope, which `next-version.sh` confirmed.
The one defect of the issue is in the published close comment, not the code.

### Observations

#### What went well

- The plan's per-step predicted checker-output table held exactly at every step (3E/2W, 14E/2W, 3E/6W), turning `./scripts/roadmap-check.mjs` into a live acceptance test for each TDD step rather than a final check.
- Planning ran the candidate `EDGE` regex over every roadmap diagram in the repo (`/tmp/spike902b.mjs`, turns 36–37) and found a fourth spelling the issue never listed: the pipe-labelled edge the old parser silently dropped.
  Organic corpus data beat the issue's enumeration.
- Every TDD step ran a killing mutation, and the extra reds were read as discriminating rather than dismissed as noise.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `instruction-violation` (self-identified at retro) — the ship session announced "Loading required skills: `git-workflow`, `releasing`, `github-voice`, `worktrees`" but read only `git-workflow` and `worktrees`.
   `github-voice` carries "back every claim" and "never present speculation as fact", the two rules the close comment then broke.
   Impact: enabled friction point 2.
2. `missing-context` (self-identified at retro) — the close comment on #902 published two false behavior claims.
   It said "`pnpm fallow` roadmap validation now flags…", but the checker is `./scripts/roadmap-check.mjs`, run by `/plan-improvements` and `/finish-phase` and wired into neither `package.json` nor CI.
   It said drifted edges were previously "silently parsed as a hard dependency", but a bare `-.->` parsed as soft and a pipe-labelled edge was dropped.
   The step 9 check re-resolved every SHA and verified nothing else in the draft; the TDD stage note and the feat commit subjects held the correct wording.
   Impact: a wrong public record on the issue until corrected.
3. `other` (zsh glob) — the peer planning session hit `no matches found` three times (`docs/*.md` twice, `docs/retro/*902*` once), each time with a `2>/dev/null` that cannot suppress a zsh glob abort.
   Retro #938 recorded the same form and deliberately left the rule unmechanized.
   Impact: three retried calls, no rework.
4. `instruction-violation` (self-identified mid-session) — TDD step 4 committed with `git commit -q -F - <<'MSG'`.
   The `git commit -F` deny rule did not fire: the matcher is anchored (`^…$`), and the parsed command text for this spelling is `git commit -q -F`, which the exact pattern does not match.
   No approval prompt fired either, so the harm the rule guards against did not occur.
   Impact: none.
5. `other` — the plan draft failed `rumdl` twice (backslash-escaped backticks inside a code span, an unused `[#859]` definition).
   Impact: two extra calls, no rework.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- None observed; the planning gate's single `ask_user` settled vocabulary, check direction, and bullet scope in one pass because the message ahead of it carried a measured warning-count table per option.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — planning and TDD ran on `claude-opus-5-5`; sync and ship on `claude-sonnet-5`; both subagents (`tidy-first-assessor`, `pre-completion-reviewer`) on `claude-sonnet-5` per their transcripts.
  The one defect landed in the Sonnet ship session, in the only judgment-heavy step it owns (drafting the behavior sentence); the mechanical steps were clean.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — TDD ran the scoped Vitest suite after every edit and `./scripts/roadmap-check.mjs` after every behavior step; no gap.

### Changes made

1. Corrected the behavior sentence of the #902 close comment (comment `5851613557`) to name `./scripts/roadmap-check.mjs` and the true prior behavior (bare `-.->` parsed as soft, pipe-labelled edges dropped).
2. `.pi/prompts/ship.md` step 9: the behavior-sentence bullet now requires wording from the feat/fix commit bodies and the TDD stage note, with the entry point named as the code spells it.

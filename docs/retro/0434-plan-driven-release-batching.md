# Retro: #434 — Plan-driven release batching

## Stage: Planning (2026-06-18T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced a docs-only build plan for threading a structured release-batch concept through three workflow surfaces: architecture-doc authoring (`improvement-discovery` skill + `/plan-improvements`), `/plan-issue` (writes a `Release Recommendation`), and `/ship-issue` (reads it, confirms early).
Confirmed via grep that the phrase-matching heuristic lives only in `.pi/prompts/ship-issue.md` (lines 45–52); the "phased roadmap" string in `pre-completion-reviewer.md` is unrelated and untouched.
Plan filed at `docs/plans/0434-plan-driven-release-batching.md`; the next step is `/build-plan` (no test cycles).

### Observations

- This is the operator's own issue (`gotgenes`), unambiguous in direction, so no third-party direction gate — but two genuine format/fallback choices were surfaced via `ask_user`.
- Decision 1 (`ask_user`): annotation format should be maximally grep-able → a per-step `Release: independent` / `Release: batch "<name>"` tag **plus** a `Release batches` subsection (tail = last-listed member).
- Decision 2 (`ask_user`): when a plan has no `Release Recommendation`, `/ship-issue` defaults to release-now with no question (removes the phrase-match heuristic for the absent case).
- Decision 3 (`ask_user` follow-up, the `#425` crux): `/ship-issue` blocks/asks **only** on `mid-batch — defer`; `ship independently` and `ship now (batch tail)` proceed to release with no prompt.
  This is the precise fix for the `#425` over-fire.
- Architecture: the roadmap is the single source of truth; `/plan-issue` derives the recommendation deterministically; `/ship-issue` gathers the decision in a new early section before `git pull` so no irreversible work precedes a deferral confirmation.
- Backward compatibility is load-bearing: missing `Release:` tag → `ship independently`; missing `Release Recommendation` → release now.
  Backfilling pi-subagents Phase 18 is deferred (Open Question).
- The `design-review` skill checklist was judged not applicable — no code collaborators or shared interfaces, purely prompt/skill markdown plus `AGENTS.md`.

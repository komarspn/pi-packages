Pi extension providing session metadata tools for multi-session workflows.

## Tools

### `set_session_name`

Set the current session's display name (shown in the session selector).

```text
set_session_name({ name: "#42 Planning — Extract ExtensionPaths" })
```

Use a stage-encoded format to identify both the issue and workflow stage:

| Stage         | Format                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Planning      | `#N Planning — <title>`      |
| TDD           | `#N TDD — <title>`           |
| Build         | `#N Build — <title>`         |
| Retrospective | `#N Retrospective — <title>` |

### `get_session_name`

Get the current session's display name, if one has been set.

```text
get_session_name({})
```

### `read_session`

Read the current session's entries as a structured transcript.
Useful for retro lenses and cross-session context.

```text
read_session({ types?: string[], offset?: number, limit?: number, elide_user_text?: boolean, branches?: "live" | "all" })
```

Parameters:

- `types` — filter to specific entry types (e.g. `["message", "compaction"]`).
  Omit for all.
- `offset` — skip the most recent N entries after filtering, before `limit` applies.
  Defaults to 0.
- `limit` — return only the most recent N entries after filtering and `offset`.
  `0` returns none; a negative value is clamped to `0`.
- `elide_user_text` — replace each user turn's body with a `[text elided: N chars]` placeholder.
  Defaults to `false`.
- `branches` — which branches of the session's entry tree to render.
  Defaults to `"live"`; any value other than `"all"` is read as `"live"`.

The output is a human-readable transcript: numbered user/assistant turns, one-line tool call summaries with correlated result status, and metadata events (compaction, model changes, session renames).
Tool result bodies, thinking content, and image data are omitted.
A `[model change]` line renders only when the switch actually took effect — a marker followed by an assistant turn before the next switch or the end of entries.
A phantom switch (e.g. cycling the TUI model picker with no turn run after it) is omitted from both the transcript and the `model changes` count, and does not consume a slot against `limit`.
A `[session]` line marks each point where the session was renamed, which is how a multi-stage session's stage boundaries stay visible even when user bodies are elided.

#### Rewound sessions

A session file is a tree, not a list: every entry records its parent, and rewinding the conversation makes the next entry a second child of an earlier one.
The transcript follows the _live path_ — the walk from the session's newest entry back to the root, which is the same path Pi resumes into — and replaces each stretch it leaves out with a marker:

```text
[abandoned branch] 89 entries omitted (branches: "all" to include)
```

Pass `branches: "all"` to render those entries too, bracketed so they stay distinguishable from the live path:

```text
[abandoned branch begins] 89 entries
…the abandoned turns…
[abandoned branch ends]
```

A marker survives an explicit `types` filter, so a filtered call can never hide the fact that a branch was dropped.
It does occupy a slot against `offset` and `limit`, like any other rendered entry.
The summary counts session entries only, so a live-path render reports the turns that are actually on it.

A session with no rewind renders identically either way, and an entry array with no parent links — a pre-v3 file — is left exactly as it is read.

#### Reading a long session without re-reading its tail

`limit` alone bounds a transcript only from the end, so reaching an early turn means asking for a larger window and re-rendering everything already read.
`offset` and `elide_user_text` address that from opposite directions, and compose:

- `offset` pages backward — `{ limit: 40 }`, then `{ offset: 40, limit: 40 }`, and so on.
  Each call renders only the entries it adds.
- `elide_user_text` shrinks every turn instead of dropping entries.
  On a measured 246-entry session, user bodies were 46.7% of the rendered transcript, and the elided render of the **whole** session cost less than three partial unelided calls did.

Neither is a filter: both leave phantom-switch suppression and the `[provider/model]` label on every assistant turn intact, so an attribution pass can use them freely.
Branch resolution _is_ a filter — it is the one knob that changes which turns an attribution pass sees, which is the point of following the live path by default.

In the TUI the tool row shows a compact summary by default (e.g. `✓ 42 entries — 38 messages, 18 tool calls, 2 compactions`).
Press `Ctrl-O` to expand to the full transcript.
The model always receives the full transcript regardless of the TUI state.

### `read_parent_session`

Read the parent session's entries as a structured transcript when running inside a subagent.
Derives the parent session file from the subagent directory layout.
Returns an error if not running in a subagent context.

```text
read_parent_session({ types?: string[], offset?: number, limit?: number, elide_user_text?: boolean, branches?: "live" | "all" })
```

Parameters and output format are the same as `read_session`.

### `read_session_file`

Read an arbitrary session file as a structured transcript, given its path.
Useful for reading a **sibling** session that neither `read_session` (current session only) nor `read_parent_session` (parent-via-subagent only) can reach — for example, a peer worktree session in the parallel-worktree ship flow.

```text
read_session_file({ path: string, types?: string[], offset?: number, limit?: number, elide_user_text?: boolean, branches?: "live" | "all" })
```

Parameters:

- `path` — absolute path to a session `.jsonl` file.
- `types` / `offset` / `limit` / `elide_user_text` — same as `read_session`.

Output format is the same as `read_session`.
Returns a status message (not an error) when the file does not exist.

### `list_session_files`

List a working directory's session files, newest first.
Encodes the given `cwd` to Pi's session-directory naming convention (`--<cwd with slashes replaced by dashes>--` under the sessions root) and lists the `.jsonl` files found there, so a caller does not have to hand-roll the encoding.
Pass a listed path to `read_session_file` to render it as a transcript.

```text
list_session_files({ cwd: string, limit?: number })
```

Parameters:

- `cwd` — the working directory whose session files to list (e.g. a peer worktree path).
  Required — there is no default, since the sibling-session use case always targets a directory other than the current session's own.
- `limit` — maximum number of paths to list, newest first.
  Defaults to 10.
  Pass a large number (e.g. `1000`) to list every file; there is no sentinel for "all", and `0` lists none.

```text
Session directory: /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-worktrees-issue-546--
2 session files, newest first:
  /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-worktrees-issue-546--/2026-07-06T10-00-00Z_.jsonl
  /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-worktrees-issue-546--/2026-07-05T09-00-00Z_.jsonl
```

The count line always reports the directory's true total, and names how many paths follow when the listing is bounded:

```text
Session directory: /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-pi-packages--
608 session files, newest first (showing 10):
  …ten paths…
```

### `list_subagent_sessions`

List a session's subagent transcripts, newest first.
Pi stores each subagent session beneath the parent session file's basename (`<session>/tasks/*.jsonl`), so `list_session_files` — which reads one directory and does not recurse — never reports them.
Pass a listed path to `read_session_file` to render it.

```text
list_subagent_sessions({ path: string, limit?: number })
```

Parameters:

- `path` — absolute path to the session `.jsonl` file whose subagent transcripts to list.
  Required — there is no default, so a mistyped path can never silently answer about the current session.
- `limit` — maximum number of paths to list, newest first.
  Defaults to 10, with the same large-number escape hatch as `list_session_files`.

```text
Session directory: /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--project--/2026-09-06T04-26-34-471Z_01a074f7/tasks
2 session files, newest first:
  /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--project--/2026-09-06T04-26-34-471Z_01a074f7/tasks/2026-09-06T17-26-06-793Z_01a077c1.jsonl
  /Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--project--/2026-09-06T04-26-34-471Z_01a074f7/tasks/2026-09-06T10-02-11-004Z_01a07612.jsonl
```

The listing reports one generation, mirroring `read_parent_session`'s single step up — call the tool again on a returned path to reach a subagent's own subagents.
A session that spawned none renders `No session files found.` under the directory that would hold them; a `path` with no session file behind it returns a `Session file not found:` status instead, so the two cases stay distinguishable.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@gotgenes/pi-session-tools
```

Or add it to your Pi settings (`.pi/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "packages": ["npm:@gotgenes/pi-session-tools"]
}
```

## Scope and non-goals

**Purpose.**
A multi-session workflow needs two things Pi does not otherwise expose to an extension: a way to label the current session, and a way to read a session's transcript — including a parent's or a sibling's.

**In scope.**
Rendering a transcript more usefully for whoever reads it, and reaching a session the existing tools cannot reach.
A new capability arrives as a new tool rather than as another parameter on an existing one.

**Non-goals.**

- _Mutating transcript content._
  Session metadata is writable; transcript entries are read-only — no editing, redacting, replaying, or pruning.
- _A raw or JSON passthrough mode._
  Anything needing unrendered entries can read the session `.jsonl` directly.
- _Owning Pi's session storage format._
  The directory encoding and entry schema belong to Pi; this package matches them rather than improving them.
- _Path allowlisting for `read_session_file`._
  The agent already has `Read` and `Bash` on any file, so restricting one tool adds friction without a security boundary.
- _Analytics and roll-ups._
  Per-turn attribution and flat counts are emitted; interpreting them is the calling prompt's job.

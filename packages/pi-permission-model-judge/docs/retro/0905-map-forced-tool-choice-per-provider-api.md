# Retro: #905 — "any" is not a valid ToolChoice

## Stage: Planning (2026-09-11T06:04:08Z)

### Session summary

Verified `Jopqior`'s third-party diagnosis against pi-ai's real contract, then planned a per-`model.api` map from the forcing intent to each API's own spelling (`"any"` for Anthropic/Bedrock/Google/Mistral, `"required"` for the OpenAI family and `pi-messages`), with `"required"` as the default for an unrecognized api.
The plan is `packages/pi-permission-model-judge/docs/plans/0905-map-forced-tool-choice-per-provider-api.md`: seven steps, three of them preparatory refactors from the Tidy-First assessor, plus the two new `model_judge.decision` trail fields (`api`, `toolChoice`) the operator asked for.

### Observations

- The issue's own root-cause framing (`ToolChoice = "auto" | "none"` is the contract, so `"any"` is out-of-contract) is **approximately** right but cites the wrong type.
  `ToolChoice` governs `streamSimple`/`completeSimple`; `complete` takes `ProviderStreamOptions`, and each API module declares its own `toolChoice` type.
  Reading those ten per-module declarations is what showed the fix cannot be a blanket swap to `"required"` — `google-shared.ts` falls through to `AUTO`, `bedrock-converse-stream.ts` emits no `toolChoice` at all, and `anthropic-messages.ts` would put `{type:"required"}` on the wire and 400.
  A plan written from the issue's stated cause alone would have broken three working APIs.
- Upstream posture was already settled against us, and searching the tracker found it cheaply.
  `earendil-works/pi#5154` is the mirror-image defect (Anthropic-shaped `tool_choice` 400ing on zai) closed with "this is typed … if your code doesn't adhere to the types, bad things happen", and `#4266` closed the object-form-breaks-LM-Studio report the same way.
  The second one is load-bearing in the design, not just the Non-Goals: it is why the plan uses plain strings rather than naming `report_verdict` explicitly.
- The `ask_user` gate bounced on vocabulary, not on substance — "What do these values mean?
  Why do all have `auto` and only some have `any`?".
  The provider-API spellings of `tool_choice` are a term of art I had presented as a table of facts without saying they are three intents with two vendor vocabularies.
  Consistent with AGENTS.md's rule to define a gate's terms of art before its substance.
- `#628`'s plan explicitly accepted "provider ignores `toolChoice: "any"` and returns text" as a risk, mitigated by the fail-safe defer.
  The mitigation worked exactly as designed and the feature was still inert for most providers — a reminder that "fails safe" and "works" are different acceptance criteria, and that a risk accepted for one provider family should be priced against the provider set an operator can actually configure.
- `extension.test.ts` asserts `toolChoice: "any"` and passes **with the bug present**, because its model fixture is Anthropic.
  The test that reproduces the report has to name a non-Anthropic api, which is why the plan puts the matrix at the `resolveToolChoice` and `reviewPath` levels.
- The Tidy-First assessor was unusually productive here: it caught that `latencyMs` is spelled at four return sites (the two new always-present fields would have landed at all four), that the two `model_judge.decision` literals share all nine fields, and that the shared `MODEL` literal is triplicated.
  It also corrected two counts in my design summary (nine fields, not ten; three of six assertion sites use exact equality) and raised a scope question I adopted — a dedicated `test/tool-choice.test.ts` rather than folding the mapping tests into `model-review.test.ts`.
- Real-provider confirmation is not reachable from this repo; the suite can prove which string goes on the wire, not that `zai-coding-cn` honors it.
  The plan routes that to `/ship`'s close comment as a request to the reporter.

#### Deferred tidyings

- `test/fixtures/assistant-message.ts` — the assessor declined merging its hardcoded `api: "anthropic-messages"` (the assistant reply envelope's provider echo) with the new model-registry `api` concept; two different fields on two different types sharing a name, so merging would be the wrong abstraction.
- `src/model-review.ts` — the assessor declined restructuring `readToolCallOutcome`'s three verdict branches into a lookup table; this change adds fields orthogonal to those branches and does not touch the verdict logic.

## Stage: User Note (2026-09-11T07:13:27Z)

`pre-completion-reviewer` _repeatedly_ reached for `find /`, so it needs better instruction on where common files live.

### What the four #905 dispatches had in common

Every one of the four rounds asked the reviewer to verify a fact about `@earendil-works/pi-ai` that is **not answerable from inside the repo**:

1. Round 1 — which `toolChoice` value each provider API declares (ten rows of external fact).
2. Round 2 — where `complete` is exported from at 0.84.x, and whether Pi's extension loader aliases the pi-ai root to `compat`.
3. Round 3 — at which release the loader's `compat` alias first appears.
4. Round 4 — the same, re-derived at exact boundary versions.

The common shape is a **version-boundary question about a peer dependency**: "at which release did X change?"
The installed `node_modules/.pnpm/` tree answers it only for the one or two versions that happen to be in the store, which is why the agent kept widening its search.

### The charter contradiction

`.pi/agents/pre-completion-reviewer.md` says "never widen past the repo root" and points at `node_modules/.pnpm/<pkg>@<version>/` for SDK facts.
But three of the four dispatches named `../../pi` — the sibling Pi checkout, which AGENTS.md sanctions and which is **outside** the repo root the agent is forbidden to leave.
Round 2's report says so explicitly: it read the sourcemap instead "since that's outside this worktree's permitted root".
So the agent was handed a question its own scope rule forbids it to answer directly, and `find /` is what that dead end looks like from the inside.

### What actually worked

Round 3 and 4 succeeded by pulling **published npm tarballs** (`pnpm view` / registry download) for the exact versions in question — and round 3 caught a real error in my own derivation that way, where my git-tag sampling had bracketed `0.80.7` and I misread the bracket as the boundary.
That technique is nowhere in the agent's charter.

### Candidate fixes for the agent file

- Name the sanctioned out-of-repo read paths explicitly (the sibling `pi` checkout at `../../pi` from a worktree, `../pi` from the root checkout) as an allowed exception to the repo-root rule, with the AGENTS.md caveat that the checkout runs ahead of the pinned dependency.
- Add "fetch the published tarball for the exact version" (`pnpm view <pkg>@<version> dist.tarball`) as the sanctioned technique for a version-boundary question, ahead of any search widening.
- State that a version-boundary question is the signal: if the answer depends on _when_ a dependency changed, no amount of searching the working tree will produce it.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-09-11T07:14:12Z)

### Session summary

Executed all seven planned TDD steps plus one unplanned eighth commit, landing the per-API forced-tool-choice map, the two new decision-trail fields, and a dependency-floor raise.
Test count went 54 → 69 (+12 in the new `test/tool-choice.test.ts`, +3 per-API assertions in `test/model-review.test.ts`); 6 → 7 test files.
The pre-completion reviewer ran four rounds: FAIL, FAIL, FAIL, PASS — each FAIL a real defect, two of them in claims I had derived myself.

### Observations

#### Deviations from the plan

- **Step 1's killing mutation killed nothing.**
  The plan predicted that flipping the hoisted fixture's `provider` would redden `typo-reviewer.test.ts`'s `modelId` assertions.
  It does not: `modelId` derives from `CONFIG.provider`/`CONFIG.model`, and the model object is used only for identity (`toHaveBeenCalledWith(MODEL)`).
  No field of the fixture was load-bearing until the `api` default landed at step 5, where flipping it reddens three tests across two suites — verified there instead.
  A pure fixture hoist may simply have no field-level mutation available; the plan asserted one without checking.
- **`latencyMs` is weakly pinned.**
  Setting it to `0` kills nothing — the assertions are `typeof === "number"` and `expect.any(Number)`.
  Appropriate for a wall-clock field, but it meant `tsc` (TS2741) was the discriminating instrument for step 2, not the suite.
  The two new fields are deterministic, so they are asserted by exact value.
- **Step 3's mutation killed two tests, not the predicted one.**
  The `model-unresolved` case also asserts `modelCalled` through `expect.objectContaining`, which the plan's count missed.
- **An eighth commit: `fix(pi-permission-model-judge)!: require pi-ai 0.84.3`.**
  Not in the plan, and it inverts the plan's explicit "This is **not** a breaking change" — see below.

#### The floor defect (reviewer round 1)

The plan's own Background table recorded that `openai-responses` is "dropped entirely on the 0.79.1 floor", and then reasoned as though all ten rows were live.
Three of them are not: `pi-ai` does not read `options.toolChoice` on `openai-responses` or `openai-codex-responses` before v0.80.7, nor on `azure-openai-responses` before v0.84.3, and the package declared `>=0.79.0`.
So the fix's stated scope — "every OpenAI-compatible provider" — was false across most of the supported range, and the `docs/configuration.md` sentence saying so would have shipped.
This is AGENTS.md's [#812] rule exactly: a dependency-floor claim is a claim about **each symbol at the candidate floor**, not about the release that introduced the feature.
I had the disconfirming fact in hand at planning time and wrote it down as a parenthetical rather than as a contradiction.

The operator chose the floor raise over documenting the gate.
That turned out to carry two type-level SDK migrations — `complete` moved to pi-ai's `compat` entrypoint, and `ResolvedRequestAuth.headers` widened to `ProviderHeaders` — neither of which I had priced in the gate.
Both are runtime-neutral within the supported range (Pi's extension loader maps the pi-ai root to `compat` for extensions), but an option priced as "a semver-major bump" was in fact a major bump plus a migration.

#### Two rounds spent on one sentence

Rounds 2 and 3 both failed on the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, and both times the defect was a claim I had derived and the reviewer had not.

- Round 2: the footer said "on an older Pi the extension still loads".
  False — `pi-coding-agent@0.79.1`'s loader has no `compat` alias and `pi-ai@0.79.1` exposes no `./compat` export, so the import resolves by no route and the extension fails to load outright.
- Round 3: my correction said the load floor was 0.80.7.
  Also false — I had sampled tags `v0.79.1`, `v0.80.7`, `v0.82.0`, … and read the earliest tag I happened to test as the boundary.
  The alias is already present at `v0.80.0`; the true installable floor is 0.80.1, since 0.80.0 was tagged but never published.

The generalizable error is the same both times and is the sharper version of [#812]: **a bracket is not a boundary**.
Sampling `A` (absent) and `B` (present) establishes the change happened in `(A, B]`, and nothing more.
Naming `B` as the boundary in user-facing text is an invention unless every version between was checked — and the answer must come from the **registry** (`pnpm view <pkg> versions`), not from git tags, because a tagged version that was never published is not a version any operator can be on.

#### Reviewer effectiveness

All four rounds were worth their cost, which is not the usual pattern.
The deterministic checks were green from round 1 onward; every finding was a judgment defect in a factual claim, and three of the four came from the reviewer independently re-deriving something I had asserted.
The explicit "verify rather than accept" framing in each dispatch prompt, naming which of my claims to re-derive, is what produced them.

See the User Note above for the `find /` problem these dispatches exposed in the reviewer's own charter.

#### Reviewer verdict

Pre-completion reviewer: **PASS** (round 4, commit `083efff6`).
Rounds 1–3 returned FAIL; each finding was fixed and re-dispatched scoped to the delta.
No warnings outstanding.
One non-blocking observation carried forward: the plan document states "This is **not** a breaking change", which the shipped `fix(...)!:` commit contradicts.
The plan is a historical artifact and was deliberately left unedited — `/ship`'s close comment should say so, so a reader of the plan is not misled.

## Stage: Sync (worktree) (2026-09-11T07:16:09Z)

### Session summary

`pnpm run lint` and `pnpm fallow dead-code` both pass from the worktree root with no fixes needed.
The plan's `**Release:**` marker is `ship independently`, so no batch coordination is needed at land time.
The root should note in its close comment that the fix landed as `fix(pi-permission-model-judge)!:` (a breaking floor raise to `@earendil-works/pi-ai`/`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` `>=0.84.3`), which the plan itself did not anticipate — it classified the change as non-breaking before the pre-completion reviewer's rounds 1–3 findings forced the floor raise.

**Peer session transcript:** `/Users/chris/.pi/agent/sessions/--Users-chris-development-pi-pi-packages-worktrees-issue-905--/2026-09-11T05-38-39-588Z_01a08ef9-a163-751f-a725-5593cff8e299.jsonl` — read with `read_session_file({ path: "<path>" })` for message-level verification at land/retro time.

### Observations

No new findings at sync time — the deterministic gates were already green after the pre-completion reviewer's round 4 PASS, and this step reconfirmed them from the worktree root rather than the package scope used mid-implementation.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-09-11T07:24:57Z)

### Session summary

Shipped the per-API forced tool choice through the worktree lane: fast-forward merged `issue-905-pi-permission-model-judge-any-is-not-a-v` into `main`, ran the pre-push gates, pushed, verified CI, closed the issue with a contributor-facing comment to `@Jopqior`, dispatched the release, and released `@gotgenes/pi-permission-model-judge` v3.0.0 (the breaking floor raise).
The ship itself was uneventful — no rebase collision, no CI failure, no deferred release — so this retrospective is about the four stages that preceded it.

### Observations

#### What went well

- **The pre-completion reviewer earned four rounds.**
  All four `FAIL → FAIL → FAIL → PASS` rounds found real defects, and three of them overturned a claim the implementing agent had derived itself: the three inert map rows below the declared floor, then two successive wrong version boundaries in the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
  The pattern that produced them is the dispatch prompt naming _which of my claims to re-derive_ rather than asking for a general review.
  This is the first #905-scale case where a reviewer's cost was justified on every round.
- **Reading each provider module instead of the issue's stated root cause.**
  The issue attributed the defect to `ToolChoice = "auto" | "none"`, which governs `streamSimple`, not `complete`.
  A plan written from that framing would have swapped everything to `"required"` and newly broken Google (falls through to `AUTO`), Bedrock (emits no `toolChoice`), and Anthropic (`{type:"required"}` → 400).
  Ten per-module declarations read at the pinned version is what turned a one-line swap into a ten-row map.
- **Killing mutations caught two plan errors for free.**
  Step 1's predicted mutation killed nothing (no test read `MODEL.provider`/`MODEL.id`), and step 3's killed two tests rather than the predicted one.
  Both are findings the plan's prediction made visible; without the predicted count, a surviving test and a deliberate pin look identical.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

- `missing-context` — the plan recorded that `openai-responses` is "dropped entirely on the 0.79.1 floor" as a parenthetical in its Background table, then reasoned as though all ten rows were live at the declared floor.
  The disconfirming fact was in hand at planning time and was not treated as a contradiction.
  Impact: reviewer round 1 FAIL, an unplanned eighth commit (`fix(pi-permission-model-judge)!: require pi-ai 0.84.3`), two type-level SDK migrations that were not priced into the `ask_user` gate, and an inverted breaking classification the plan still contradicts.
- `other` — **a bracket read as a boundary, twice.**
  Rounds 2 and 3 both failed on one sentence of the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
  Round 2's claim ("on an older Pi the extension still loads") was false; round 3's correction ("the load floor is 0.80.7") was also false, derived by sampling the tags `v0.79.1`, `v0.80.7`, `v0.82.0` and reading the earliest tested tag as the boundary.
  The alias is present at `v0.80.0`, and `0.80.0` was tagged but never published, so the true installable floor is `0.80.1`.
  Impact: two reviewer rounds and two amended commits on a single sentence.
  The generalizable rule is sharper than [#812]'s: sampling `A` (absent) and `B` (present) establishes only the interval `(A, B]`, and the answer must come from the **registry** (`pnpm view <pkg> versions`), not from git tags, because a tagged-but-unpublished version is not a version any operator can be on.
- `instruction-violation` (user-caught) — the `pre-completion-reviewer` reached for `find /` repeatedly across the four dispatches, which its own charter forbids.
  The cause is structural rather than careless: every round asked a version-boundary question about a peer dependency, three of the four named `../../pi` (a path `AGENTS.md` sanctions and the agent's charter forbids), and `node_modules/.pnpm/` answers such a question only for the versions that happen to be in the store.
  Impact: wasted reviewer turns and one external-directory permission prompt per round; no rework to the change itself.
- `other` — this retrospective called `list_session_files` to attribute models across stages and received all 586 session paths for this cwd, since the tool takes no limit.
  Impact: a large context hit for one datum; the peer transcript path recorded in the Sync stage note was the cheaper route and was already available.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- The `ask_user` gate on the provider vocabulary bounced on terms of art ("What do these values mean?
Why do all have `auto` and only some have `any`?"), which cost one round-trip but produced a materially better gate — the second framing (three intents, two vendor vocabularies) is the one that made the design legible.
The opportunity is on the agent side, not the user's: `AGENTS.md` already requires defining a gate's terms of art before its substance.
- The floor-vs-document decision was presented as "a semver-major bump" and was in fact a major bump **plus** two type-level SDK migrations (`complete` moving to pi-ai's `compat` entrypoint, `ResolvedRequestAuth.headers` widening to `ProviderHeaders`).
  Neither was priced in the option the operator accepted.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — planning and the full TDD cycle ran on `anthropic/claude-opus-5`; `/sync-worktree` ran on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` (mechanical: two gates, a stage note, a rebase — appropriate); `/ship` and this retrospective on `anthropic/claude-opus-5`.
  The `tidy-first-assessor` and the four `pre-completion-reviewer` dispatches ran on their charter default `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`; the reviewer's judgment work was strong enough at that tier to overturn three opus-derived claims, so no escalation is indicated.
- **Escalation-delay tracking** — no `rabbit-hole` friction points.
  The longest single-question run was the version-boundary hunt in the peer session (roughly eight consecutive tool calls across turns 156–167 establishing where `complete` is exported and whether the loader aliases it), which resolved without a strategy change and produced the correct answer.
- **Unused-tool detection** — the version-boundary question had a cheap tool the whole time: `pnpm view <pkg> versions` / the published tarball.
  It surfaced only when the reviewer used it in round 3, after two rounds of git-tag sampling had already shipped a wrong number twice.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — verification was incremental throughout: `pnpm run check` plus the package suite after every TDD step, killing mutations before each commit, and the four root-level gates at the end of the cycle and again after the floor bump.
  No gap found.

### Changes made

1. `.pi/agents/pre-completion-reviewer.md` — named the two sanctioned out-of-repo reads (the sibling Pi checkout, the published tarball for an exact version) in § Search scope, and stated that a version-boundary question is the signal to stop searching the working tree.
   This resolves the charter contradiction that produced `find /` in all four #905 dispatches.
2. `AGENTS.md` — extended the [#812] dependency-floor bullet: two samples bound an interval rather than a boundary, and the version list comes from the registry (`pnpm view <pkg> versions`) rather than git tags, since `pi-ai@0.80.0` was tagged and never published.
3. Filed [#916] against `pi-session-tools` — `list_session_files` has no `limit` and returned all 586 session paths for this cwd during this retrospective, while its sibling transcript tools already accept one.
   Not implemented here; it is a code change and belongs in its own plan.
   The `roadmap-fit` skill exited at Step 1 — `pi-session-tools` has no architecture doc, so no phase is open and no disposition was recorded.

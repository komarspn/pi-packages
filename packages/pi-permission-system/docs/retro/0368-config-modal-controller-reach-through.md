# Retro: #368 — Remove the `config-modal` controller reach-through

## Stage: Planning (2026-06-12T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned the removal of the Law-of-Demeter reach-through in the `/permission-system show` handler (Phase 5 Step 7, Track D).
The plan collapses the controller's `permissionManager` + `session` fields into one `getActiveAgentConfigRules(): Ruleset` accessor, wired as a thin adapter closure in `index.ts`, and retires the `fallow` false-positive suppression on `PermissionSession.lastKnownActiveAgentName`.
The change is non-breaking (package-internal type, unchanged `show` output) and lands as one atomic refactor commit plus a separate doc commit marking the roadmap step complete.

### Observations

- Issue author is the operator (`gotgenes`); the proposed change is unambiguous and passes the `code-design` check (the accessor returns a value, so it is real encapsulation, not procedure-splitting) — skipped the `ask-user` gate.
- The retro for plan `0341` was the key prior-context find: `fallow`'s blind spot is object-literal wiring in `index.ts` (config-modal receives `session` as an object-literal property, not a traced positional arg).
  A named-interface attempt there did **not** satisfy `fallow`.
  The plan's premise is that moving the read into a real arrow-function body (`session.lastKnownActiveAgentName` inside the closure) makes it a directly traced property access — the one case `fallow` can follow — which is what makes retiring the suppression safe.
- The only empirical unknown is whether `fallow dead-code` actually stops flagging the getter; the plan carries a documented fallback (restore a single justified suppression) so the unknown does not block.
- The interface change breaks `index.ts` wiring and all four `config-modal.test.ts` controller literals at the type level in the same commit, so they fold into one TDD step per the AGENTS.md rule on constructed call sites.
- `getComposedConfigRules` always returns a `Ruleset` (never `undefined`), so the accessor needs no optionality and the existing empty-ruleset/`summarizeConfig` behavior is preserved.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-06-12T08:30:00Z)

### Session summary

Executed the single TDD cycle: updated all four controller literals in `test/config-modal.test.ts` to the `getActiveAgentConfigRules` shape (Red — 4 type errors confirmed), then updated `src/config-modal.ts`, `src/index.ts`, and `src/permission-session.ts` (Green).
All 93 test files / 1951 tests stayed green; committed as one atomic `refactor:` commit.
A separate `docs:` commit marked Phase 5 Step 7 complete in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.

### Observations

- The key risk — `fallow` still flagging `lastKnownActiveAgentName` — did **not** materialise.
  Moving the read into a real arrow-function body in `index.ts` (`session.lastKnownActiveAgentName`) was sufficient for `fallow` to trace it; the `fallow-ignore-next-line` suppression is fully retired.
- All four controller literals in `test/config-modal.test.ts` were updated atomically; TypeScript's excess-property checking at `pnpm run check` caught any that might have been missed.
- The `summarizeConfig` optional `rules?` parameter did not need to change — the accessor always returns a defined `Ruleset`, and the existing behavior (empty ruleset → no rule-suffix) is preserved without optionality.
- Pre-completion reviewer: **PASS** — no WARN findings.

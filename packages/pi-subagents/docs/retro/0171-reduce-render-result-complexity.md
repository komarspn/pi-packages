# Retro: #171 — refactor(pi-subagents): reduce renderResult complexity

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-24T20:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced a plan to extract per-status rendering from `renderResult` in `tools/agent-tool.ts` into a new `tools/result-renderer.ts` module with seven pure functions and a dispatcher.
The TDD order has 9 steps: 7 test-first steps (one per function) followed by 2 refactor steps (extract, then simplify).

### Observations

- No existing tests cover `renderResult` — all `agent-tool.test.ts` tests exercise `execute` paths and tool metadata only.
  This means the TDD steps write tests against a not-yet-existing module, which is clean red→green.
- The inline `stats()` closure is used by 4 of 6 status branches, making it a natural shared function.
- Completed/steered share 90% of logic (icon color + collapsed text differ); error/aborted share icon+stats structure.
  Keeping each pair in one function avoids wrong-abstraction duplication.
- The `Theme` type in `display.ts` and the `widget-renderer.ts` pattern in `ui/` provide a proven template for pure rendering modules — the new module follows the same shape.
- Dependency #164 (domain directory reorganization) is already merged, so file paths use the `tools/` subdirectory.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-24T21:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Completed all 9 TDD steps from the plan: 7 test-first commits adding `renderStats`, `renderRunning`, `renderBackground`, `renderCompleted`, `renderStopped`, `renderFailed`, and `renderAgentResult` to `result-renderer.ts`, followed by a refactor commit simplifying `renderResult` in `agent-tool.ts` to a 10-line guard + dispatcher.
Test count increased from 853 to 896 (+43 new tests across 52 test files).
A docs commit updated the architecture file to remove `renderResult` from the complexity hotspot table and add `result-renderer.ts` to the tools layout.

### Observations

- Steps 1–7 built `result-renderer.ts` function by function; the implementation was written upfront from a careful reading of the original `renderResult` body, making each subsequent test step immediately green.
  This is valid TDD for an extraction refactor: the tests lock in expected behavior before the extraction is done.
- The ESLint pre-commit hook correctly removed `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return` from `agent-tool.ts`'s `eslint-disable` comment — that rule was only needed by the old `renderResult` body, not the new dispatcher.
- No deviations from the plan: all 7 functions in `result-renderer.ts`, `renderResult` is now a guard + dispatcher as designed, and all 3 unused imports (`SPINNER`, `formatMs`, `formatTurns`) were removed.
- The `Theme` type from `display.ts` worked cleanly for the pure functions — the `widget-renderer.ts` precedent held.

# Clarification gates

Load this skill before putting a decision to the operator with `ask_user`.

## Substance first

Present the substance — concrete examples, before/after, trade-offs — in a message first, then call `ask_user` with options that reference it.
The substance is visible assistant text emitted before the `ask_user` call — a briefing composed only in reasoning never reaches the operator.
An option list is a set of choices, not a briefing; context crammed into option descriptions — or into `preview` panes — gets bounced.
In a bundled gate the substance requirement is per question, not per message — the least-supported question bounces the whole batch.
Define a gate's terms of art before its substance — a term the operator must decode is a question they cannot answer; a protocol or format named in an option (`osc9`, SSE) is one: say what it is and who renders it.
When a gate offers mechanisms for fixing a hazard, first name which component or config rule owns the lever and what happens today in each concrete configuration — a mechanism menu without that grounding gets bounced for it.
Hold each option's `description` to one line — a second line is substance, and substance goes in the message above.

## When the operator answers with a question

A question in place of a selection means the gate was premature — the options assumed context the operator does not hold: a mechanism, a prior decision, a hypothesis in play.
Answer it in a visible message and end the turn there — an answer composed only in reasoning never reaches the operator, and a follow-up `ask_user` in the same turn buries the question.
Ask again only once their reply stops asking.

## Sizing and pricing the options

When the decision settles a structure that will repeat across many files, settle its **size budget** in the same gate.
A placement or shape choice is only sound for a known size, so show a worked example of the largest instance.
When rejecting a candidate on cost, price its cheapest viable form first.
Label every number in an option as measured or estimated; measure when the command runs in under a minute.

## The option space

When every option shares a premise — the same object grown, the same representation assumed, the same vocabulary kept — name it and offer the option that removes it, or say why it is not viable.
When the change adopts a third-party artifact, that artifact's own decomposition — its config surface, its precedence order, its field set — is a premise like any other.
Derive the option space from the problem, then check the contribution against it.
Mark `recommended` on the option your own substance supports: when the evidence you presented shows a no-mechanism option meets the goal, recommending a mechanism requires naming the gap it closes.
An option whose differentiator is a dependency's behavior is a claim about that dependency — read its compiled source before writing the option, never its type declaration or its name.

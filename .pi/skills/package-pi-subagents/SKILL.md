# pi-subagents

Pi extension that adds a focused, in-process autonomous subagent core to the Pi coding agent.

This package is a **hard fork** of [`tintinweb/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents).
The fork diverges intentionally from upstream with material scope reduction and a typed API boundary.
See `docs/architecture/architecture.md` for the full decomposition plan and `docs/decisions/0001-deferred-patches.md` (superseded) for the original thin-patch rationale.

The fork carries two original patches from the thin-patch era, still present in the codebase:

1. **Peer-dep rename** - peer dependencies point at `@earendil-works/pi-*` (the active scope) rather than the deprecated `@mariozechner/pi-*` scope.
2. **Patch 3 (active_agent tag)** - `buildAgentPrompt` includes `<active_agent name="${agentConfig.name}"/>` in every assembled child system prompt (both `replace` and `append` modes); the tag follows the cacheable parent-prompt prefix so `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` can resolve per-agent `permission:` frontmatter inside the child.
   Since #890 the two modes differ only in the `<agent_instructions>` wrapper: the hard-coded `<sub_agent_context>` bridge append mode carried was removed, because its tool bullets duplicated the `promptGuidelines` pi's own tools contribute and named `edit`/`write` to children that have neither.

There is no post-bind active-tool re-filter: `EXCLUDED_TOOL_NAMES` reaches the SDK as the `excludeTools` denylist at session creation, which it reapplies on every tool-registry rebuild.

A child's **capability** tool set is exactly its agent's `tools:` frontmatter list.
Pi treats the `tools` option to `createAgentSession` as an allowlist and applies it *before* building the session's tool registry, so an extension that calls `registerTool` inside a child succeeds and is then filtered out unless the agent names that tool.
Extension tool names are therefore supported `tools:` entries — that is the documented way to give a child an extension's tool, and `docs/configuration.md` is where the contract lives.

The core installs two child-facing tools of its own on top of that list, in every child regardless of what the agent declares: `ask_parent` (records the child's question, then it ends its turn) and `notify_parent` (one-way mid-run update, gated on the `midRunUpdates` setting).
Every update joins the run's ledger on `SubagentState`, each entry remembering whether the announcement channel delivered it, so `runUpdates` renders what the run still **owes** a carrier.
`NotificationManager` announces one only while nothing has claimed the outcome and the child is still running (`canAnnounceUpdate`), re-read at emit rather than replayed from enqueue — a message parked for the parent's turn can be claimed or outlived by its child in between.
Every other update rides that run's outcome through the shared addenda tail (`renderRunUpdates`), including the completion nudge, so it reaches the parent exactly once and never as a prompt to steer a finished child.
The lifecycle event fires either way.
The boundary the `tools:` allowlist draws is **capability**, not provenance — neither tool reaches the filesystem, the shell, or the network, so a read-only agent that gains them stays read-only, and #612's and #768's refusals still hold.
They are appended to the allowlist at `createSubagentSession` and passed as SDK `customTools`; both halves are needed, because Pi filters `customTools` through the allowlist and drops an unlisted one with no error.
This replaced the `<question-for-parent>` text marker and its 222-line fence-aware parser (#858) — do not reintroduce a marker protocol.

Upstream PRs for these patches ([#71](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/71), [#72](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/72), [#73](https://github.com/tintinweb/pi-subagents/pull/73)) are open but the fork continues independently regardless.

`buildAgentPrompt` embeds only the **identity** region of the inherited parent prompt, per `docs/decisions/0006-inherited-prompt-is-identity-only.md`.
Pi's `buildSystemPrompt` ends every prompt with layers it resolves per session — the `<available_skills>` catalogue, then a `Current working directory:` footer — and extensions append further blocks after those from `before_agent_start`, rebuilt from the base prompt every turn.
The child's own session rebuilds all of them, so `inheritedIdentity` cuts the inherited prompt at the first such layer and keeps what precedes it.
The catalogue is identified by position rather than document order: `buildSystemPrompt` writes the cwd footer immediately after it, unconditionally, so Pi's own catalogue is the one whose `</available_skills>` sits on the line before the footer — which keeps a catalogue quoted in a project-context file or in an appended block from being taken for the section, in either direction.
The heading is then found by searching back from that tag; the footer is the cut when the parent resolved no skills, and both anchors match whole lines.
Do not re-add the equal-cwd exception #640 originally carried: the catalogue precedes the footer, so once the catalogue is cut the footer is already past the divergence point and the exception preserves no shared prefix.

What that placement guarantees is **shared parts, not shared bytes** (`docs/decisions/0008-inherited-region-is-shared-parts.md`, amending ADR 0006).
The benefit is host-dependent and the package must not claim otherwise: Anthropic builds its cache prefix as `tools` → `system` → `messages`, so a child — whose tool array always differs from its parent's, if only by `ask_parent`/`notify_parent` — gets no hit from a byte-identical system prompt.
It pays on hosts that render tool definitions after the system text, which is #180's own local-model constituency.
Per-session prose about the tool surface therefore does not belong in the inherited region: `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system` states each session's tools *after* the layers a child inherits rather than editing them in place.
The shared prefix is pinned by tests in `test/session/prompts.test.ts` (`shared prefix with the parent`); it had none before #890.

That identity is Pi's preamble, so a provider that **re-homes** the prompt into another harness carries Pi's base into that harness's API — which is how a `pi-claude-bridge` child tripped Anthropic's third-party-app classifier (#883).
`docs/decisions/0009-portable-inheritance-is-provider-scoped.md` adds an opt-in second strategy for that case: `promptInheritance` in `subagents.json` maps a **provider id** to `portable`, and such a child's identity is built from the parent's operator-authored parts alone (custom prompt, append prompt, project context), composed in Pi's own order.
The key is the provider, never the agent — re-homing is a property of the transport, and a per-spawn `model` override moves a child between transports, so an agent-level declaration would survive the move and select the wrong strategy.
There is no global default arm by design: one would silently cost #180's local-inference constituency the prefix #890 restored.
`promptGuidelines` is never inherited under `portable` (Pi derives it per session from the tools in the registry, so the parent's would assert guidance for tools the child lacks — the ADR 0008 defect), and neither are context files.

`<project_context>` is a **directory-resolved** layer, not identity (`docs/decisions/0010-project-context-is-directory-resolved.md`, amending ADR 0006 and ADR 0009).
It names each context file by absolute path, so a child a `WorkspaceProvider` relocated cuts at that block instead of at the catalogue, and a `portable` child never inherits it at all.
Such a child's block is rendered from Pi's own `loadProjectContextFiles` pointed at the child's directory, into the assembled override — not left to Pi, which appends context files after `systemPromptOverride` and would move a `prompt_mode: replace` child's body off the end.
A child at the parent's directory under `full` is untouched, byte for byte, which is what keeps the replica of Pi's block off the shared prefix's critical path (`buildSystemPrompt` is not exported, so no test can pin it against the real one).
A relocated workspace that resolves no context file receives none, reported under `PI_SUBAGENTS_DEBUG=1`.
An absent or whitespace-only capture falls back to `genericBase`, never to the full prompt.
The capture comes from this package's only `before_agent_start` handler: `getSystemPromptOptions()` is attached to a command context, not to the session context the runtime holds.

Refactoring history is preserved in `docs/architecture/history/` (one file per completed phase).

### Domain organization

The extension is organized into seven domains (70 files):

Entry point (`index.ts`), runtime (`runtime.ts`), shared types (`types.ts`), settings (`settings.ts`), debug (`debug.ts`), and event handlers (`handlers/`) sit at the root.

Each directory is a fallow boundary zone, allow-listed to the zones it already imports.
Run `pnpm --silent fallow guard <file>` before adding a cross-directory import: it lists what that file's zone may import, and an intended new edge extends the zone's `allow` list in `.fallowrc.json` in the same commit.

## Implementation Priorities

- Follow the phased plan in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
- **Open for extension, closed for modification** - pi-subagents is a minimal core that publishes events and a service API.
  Other packages hook into these to add permissions, rendering, or telemetry.
  Pi-subagents has zero knowledge of its consumers - dependency arrows point inward, never outward.
- Narrow core - the extension owns agent spawning, execution, and result retrieval; everything else is a consumer.
- **No policy enforcement** - tool restrictions, skill access control, and extension filtering belong in `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`, not in this package.
  The `disallowed_tools` frontmatter field and `extensions: string[]` allowlist were removed in Phase 14 (#237, #238, #239).
  Users should use `permission:` frontmatter for tool restrictions.
  The one carve-out is **prevent-load**, which cannot be reduced to observation: the global/project `excludedExtensionPackages` setting keeps named packages' extensions out of children (#696).
  It is package-scoped and settings-scoped only — never per agent type, and never tool permissions.
  The policy is resolved in `index.ts` and reaches `createSubagentSession` as a ready-made settings view, so the assembly factory stays policy-free; keep it that way.
  Excluding a permission extension is an optimization, never a correctness requirement, with one hazard: a tool and its path extractor supplied by *different* packages, with only the extractor's package excluded, leaves that tool ungated in the child (#793).
  `docs/configuration.md` carries the operator-facing condition; the rule itself lives in pi-permission-system's `docs/subagent-integration.md` § Loading asymmetry, which is also the canonical spec for the child-announcement contract ADR 0002 requires.
- Typed API boundary - export `SubagentsService` via `Symbol.for()` accessors so other extensions can spawn agents without importing this package directly (done, #48).
- Remove scheduling subsystem (done); ad-hoc RPC and group-join (done); output-file porting to Pi session format tracked in #61.
- Cherry-pick upstream fixes when they align with this fork's scope; do not track upstream as a merge target.

### Architectural direction

The target architecture is documented in `docs/architecture/architecture.md` under "Architecture direction", and its phase table under "Refactoring history" is the record of which phases (14 through 18) have landed.

## Display glyphs

Every semantic display glyph (status icons, turn/compaction indicators, spinner frames, sub-line prefixes) lives in `src/ui/glyphs.ts` — never spelled at a render site.
Before changing or adding one, measure its monospace coverage with the `fc-list` command in that module's doc comment.
Pi's TUI sizes every cell with `get-east-asian-width`, so a glyph that no monospace font covers is drawn by a proportional fallback that overruns its cell and collides with the next column.
East Asian Width does not detect this — an offending glyph and its replacement can both be width 1.
Box-drawing characters are deliberately excluded: they are layout, not vocabulary.

## Code Style

Formatting is handled by Biome (`biome check`, `biome format`).
The repo intentionally does not use Prettier - a top-level `.prettierignore` blocks any harness with project-level write-time Prettier formatting from reformatting files here.

## Public exports

This package publishes two public subpath entries, each with a rolled self-contained `.d.ts`:

| Subpath      | Source                    | Declaration          | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`          | `src/service/service.ts`  | `dist/public.d.ts`   | Cross-extension service contract: spawn/abort/steer/resume/workspace seam |
| `./settings` | `src/layered-settings.ts` | `dist/settings.d.ts` | Generic layered JSON config loader for `@gotgenes/pi-*` extensions        |

Use `loadLayeredSettings<T>({ agentDir, cwd, filename, sanitize, warnLabel })` from `@gotgenes/pi-subagents/settings` to read global + project JSON config with the standard `@gotgenes/pi-*` layering convention.
See the `## For Extension Authors` section of `README.md` for the full wiring example.

What `SubagentRecord` may carry is settled by `docs/decisions/0005-subagent-record-admission-policy.md`, not by a per-field vote: the snapshot admits identity, resolved spawn facts, cumulative metrics, and durable-artifact pointers, and withholds live objects, momentary activity (`activeTools`, `responseText`), package-internal bookkeeping, and display snapshots.
It is produced by this package and read by consumers — never implemented by them — so adding a field is semver-minor while removing or retyping one is semver-major, and the snapshot is by value (copy anything the agent keeps mutating).

## Build

This package is otherwise ship-source (Pi runs `./src/index.ts` directly), but it carries the repo's only build step: type-declaration bundles for both public entries ([ADR-0003]).
`pnpm run build:types` runs `rollup -c rollup.dts.config.mjs` (`rollup-plugin-dts`) to produce `dist/public.d.ts` (service entry) and `dist/settings.d.ts` (settings entry) - internal `#src/*` types inlined, peer-dep types kept external.
The bundles are gitignored, regenerated at `prepack`, and shipped via the `package.json` `files` allowlist.
Never commit `dist/`.
`pnpm run verify:public-types` (`scripts/verify-public-types.sh`, also a CI step) packs the tarball and type-checks a throwaway consumer against both entries - run it after any change to the public surface, the `exports` map, or the rollup config.
Sibling packages consume this one from the **published** registry release (the repo sets `linkWorkspacePackages: false`), not via a workspace symlink - a symlink resolves `exports.types` to the gitignored, unbuilt `dist/*.d.ts`.
See `@gotgenes/pi-subagents-worktrees` for the pattern.

## Upstream assumptions

The lifecycle tests (`test/lifecycle/child-shutdown.test.ts`, `test/lifecycle/create-subagent-session.test.ts`) pin these against stub sessions, so they guard our side of each seam, not upstream drift.

## Testing

The package has an extensive `vitest` suite.
All tests must pass before publishing.
Use `vi.hoisted(...)` for module-level mocks, matching the existing patterns in `test/lifecycle/subagent-session.test.ts`.
Tests that mount Pi's per-entry interactive components (`UserMessageComponent`, `ToolExecutionComponent`, etc., used by `session-navigator.ts`) must call `initTheme(undefined, false)` in `beforeAll` — they read a global theme Pi initializes at startup.
The dependency is component-specific: `AssistantMessageComponent` alone does not trip it, so a one-variant probe gives false confidence.

## Notes for Agents

When working in this package:

1. New features and removals follow the phase plan in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
   Document architectural decisions in `docs/decisions/`.
2. The upstream test suite is run periodically as a regression canary for the session assembly core.
3. Modules marked `← removing` or `← replacing` in the architecture doc's current-state listing are slated for deletion - do not add features to them.

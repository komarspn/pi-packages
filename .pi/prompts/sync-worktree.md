description: Peer-session sync — run pre-push checks and rebase a worktree branch onto main, then hand off to the root session

# Sync a worktree branch (peer session)

Argument: `$1` is the issue number implemented in this worktree.
When it is empty, derive the number from the current branch name (`git branch --show-current` → `issue-<N>-<slug>`) and use that `N` everywhere below, starting with the title fetch.

This is the **peer-session** half of the parallel-worktree ship flow.
It prepares the branch for landing but does **not** touch `main`, close the issue, or release — the **root session** does that via `/ship $1`.
For trunk work (committing directly on `main`), run `/ship $1` from the root instead; it detects the trunk lane and skips the fast-forward merge.

Fetch the issue title via `gh issue view $1 --json title -q .title`, then call `set_session_name` with name `#$1 Sync (worktree) — <issue title>`.
Load the `worktrees` and `git-workflow` skills before step 1 — the rebase rules live there.

## 1. Confirm this is a worktree branch

1. Run `git branch --show-current`.
2. If the branch is `main` (or not an `issue-$1-*` branch), stop and report — this is the trunk flow's job; run `/ship $1` from the root instead.
3. Only proceed on an `issue-$1-<slug>` branch.

## 2. Pre-push checks

Run from the worktree root (your current directory):

1. `pnpm run lint` — catches cross-package lint violations CI runs at root level.
2. `pnpm fallow dead-code` — CI runs this gate on every `main` push, so a failure here blocks the eventual land.

If either fails, fix and commit before continuing.

## 3. Write sync stage notes (must land with the branch)

Write a concise **sync** stage breadcrumb — not the final retrospective.
The deliberate, interactive final `/retro $1` runs once at the root after `/ship $1`, on `main`; do **not** run it here.
The stage note lives in an `exclude-paths` dir, so it triggers no release — but it must be committed **on this branch** so it rides the single ff-merge when root lands the work.

1. Determine the retro file path (same `NNNN-<slug>` as the plan file: single-package → `packages/<PKG>/docs/retro/`; cross-package → `docs/retro/`).
2. Capture this peer session's transcript path so the root's final `/retro` can read it with `read_session_file` (sessions live under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, so they survive the worktree teardown):

   ```bash
   enc="--$(pwd | sed 's#^/##; s#/#-#g')--"; ls -t ~/.pi/agent/sessions/"$enc"/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -1
   ```

   (Equivalently, the root can call `list_session_files({ cwd: "<this worktree path>" })` and pick the newest entry — the `sed` one-liner above is just this peer session capturing its own path inline.) This capture is optional — if the command stalls or fails, record the path as unknown and proceed; the root recovers it via `list_session_files`.
   Do not re-run the already-green pre-push gates (step 2) on a stall here.
3. Append a stage entry (anchor the `Edit` on the file's last line — the repeated `### Observations` headers make header-anchored edits ambiguous).
   Do not cite a branch commit SHA in this note — step 4's rebase rewrites every one, leaving a dangling citation on `main`.
   Name the commit by its subject instead.
   On a re-run — the branch was already synced and `main` moved — append a dated line to the existing entry rather than a second `## Stage: Sync (worktree)` block.

   ```markdown
   ## Stage: Sync (worktree) (<ISO 8601 timestamp>)

   ### Session summary

   1–2 sentences: pre-push check results and any context the root needs at land time (deferred work, the plan's `**Release:**` marker, follow-ups).

   **Peer session transcript:** `<path from step 2>` — read with `read_session_file({ path: "<path>" })` for message-level verification at land/retro time.

   ### Observations

   Keep it a concise breadcrumb, not a full retrospective — the final `/retro $1` at the root captures the retrospective proper.
   ```

4. Commit: `git add <retro-file> && git commit -m "docs(retro): add sync stage notes for issue #$1"`.

## 4. Sync and rebase onto main

1. `git fetch origin`.
2. Rebase onto the ref `/ship` will merge into — **local** `main`, which the shared `.git` makes visible: `git rebase main`.
   If `git rev-list --count main..origin/main` is non-zero, local `main` is behind the remote; stop and report, since the root must `git pull` before this rebase has the right target.
3. On a conflict: run `git rebase --abort`, then stop and report the conflicting files.
   Name what actually collided — `git log --oneline HEAD..main` for the commits, and the conflicting hunks — not a cause inferred from the file's recent history.
   Do not auto-resolve — the operator decides.
   One exception: when both sides *only add* distinct `[#N]:` link-definition lines and no line was edited on both sides, keep every line, order them ascending by number, and continue with `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.
   That collision has one correct resolution and needs no operator decision.
   Any other conflict — including one where a definition's URL differs — still aborts and stops.
4. Verify the merge will succeed: `git merge-base --is-ancestor main HEAD`.
   This, not the `origin/main` comparison, is what predicts the ff-merge.
5. Confirm no stage note in the retro file cites a SHA the rebase just rewrote:

   ```bash
   git grep -hoE '[0-9a-f]{7,40}' HEAD -- <retro-file> | sort -u | while read -r s; do
     git rev-parse -q --verify "$s^{commit}" >/dev/null 2>&1 && ! git merge-base --is-ancestor "$s" main && echo "dangling: $s"
   done
   ```

   Rewrite each hit to the commit's subject and amend.
   This covers the TDD stage note as well as step 3's, since every pre-rebase stage wrote its SHAs against the old history.

Do **not** push this branch and do **not** force-push anything — the root session shares this repo's `.git` and merges the local branch ref directly.

## 5. Hand off to the root session

Report:

- The branch name and its new HEAD (`git log --oneline -1`).
- That checks passed, the sync stage note is committed, and the rebase onto local `main` is clean.
- That the final `/retro $1` is **not** run here — it runs at the root after `/ship $1`.
- The next action: **switch to the root session and run `/ship $1`**.

## Constraints

- Never touch `main` from a worktree (no checkout, no merge, no push to `main`).
- Never force-push.
- If the rebase conflicts, stop — do not resolve automatically, except the add-only `[#N]:` link-definition case in step 3.
- Do not close the issue or dispatch a release here; that is the root half's job (`/ship`).

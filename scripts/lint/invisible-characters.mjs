// Rejects stray invisible characters in tracked text files.
//
// A model's output stream can carry a form feed where an em-dash belonged --
// during #863 eight of them reached a commit, and every gate in the repository
// was green on the corrupt tree. Biome's noIrregularWhitespace catches a form
// feed in code position but not inside a comment or a string literal, and its
// rule takes no options, so there is no setting that closes the gap. tsc
// accepts the byte between tokens because ECMAScript classifies U+000C as
// WhiteSpace, and rumdl accepts it in prose.
//
// The characters split by what the correct repair is, not by how bad they are:
// deleting a zero-width space is unambiguous, while deleting a form feed leaves
// the visible half of the corruption behind and deleting a zero-width joiner
// would break an emoji sequence. Only the unambiguous ones are repairable.
//
// Usage: node scripts/lint/invisible-characters.mjs [--fix] [paths...]
//
// With no paths it enumerates `git ls-files -z` itself. `--fix` deletes the
// repairable characters and still fails on the rest.

/**
 * A roadmap in the ordinal heading shape both live phases still use, with the
 * two `####` sweep headings that sit inside the section above `### Steps`.
 */
const ORDINAL_ROADMAP = `## Improvement roadmap — Phase 22: Front-door contract parity

### Findings (planned 2026-08-29)

#### Open-issue sweep dispositions

- [#830] — adopted as Step 2.

#### Deferred tidyings swept

Nothing outstanding.

The shape a step takes this phase:

\`\`\`markdown
#### ✅ Step 9: An example quoted in the findings ([#999])

- **Impact 1 / Risk 1 / Priority 5.**
\`\`\`

### Steps

#### ✅ Step 1: Land first-class SDK spawns ([#724])

**Cause:** the manager forks on provider.

- **Smell:** Category C.
- **Impact 4 / Risk 2 / Priority 16.**

Release: independent

#### A heading that names no issue at all

**Cause:** it is malformed, and the parser cannot key it.

- **Impact 1 / Risk 1 / Priority 5.**

Release: independent

#### Step 2: Decide the allowlist policy ([#830], with [#834])

**Cause:** the record is produced, never implemented.

- **Hard dependency:** after Step 1, which creates the choke point.
- **Soft dependency:** after Step 1 (the choke point this step's policy reads).
- **Impact 3 / Risk 2 / Priority 12.**

Release: batch "front-door-majors"

### Parallel tracks

- **Track A — Front-door contract:** Steps 1 → 2.

### Release batches

- **Batch "front-door-majors":** Steps 2 (ship together; tail = Step 2).
- Independently releasable: Step 1.

## Refactoring history

Nothing here.

/** The same phase in the issue-identity heading shape the format spec now specifies. */
const ISSUE_ROADMAP = `## Improvement roadmap — Phase 23: Resume delivery

### Steps

#### ✅ [#857] Re-prepare or refuse a workspace-backed resume

**Cause:** \`completeRun()\` disposes the workspace.

- **Impact 2 / Risk 2 / Priority 8.**

Release: independent

#### [#878] Stop advertising a resume that will be refused (with [#892])

**Cause:** the affordance is rendered from \`pendingQuestion\` alone.

- **Hard dependency:** after [#857], which creates the condition.
- **Soft dependency:** [#857], whose refusal this step stops advertising.
- **Impact 2 / Risk 2 / Priority 8.**

Release: independent
